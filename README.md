# SparseGrids
The package contains code to interpolate a function in 2D using Sparse Grids.

### What are sparse grids?
Solving PDEs in higher dimensions poses a computational challenge due to the [curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality).
Sparse grids [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-31703-3_3) present an alternative in overcoming the curse of dimensionality. The method is based on a hierarchical basis, which is a discrete representation of a continuous function. A sparse grid is then generated by a sparse tensor product construction, thus reducing the total number of basis functions we need to calculate while only slightly reducing the accuracy.
