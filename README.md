# SparseGrids
Research
Models such as the Lambda-CDM model give us insight to how structures form in the universe. These models require 7 dimensions (3 space, 3 momentum, 1 time) to do calculations and a full grid becomes too expensive, even for supercomputers. Sparse grids present an alternative in overcoming the curse of dimensionality. The method is based on a hierarchical basis, which is a discrete representation of a continuous function. A sparse grid is then generated by a sparse tensor product construction, thus reducing the total number of basis functions we need to calculate while only slightly reducing the accuracy. This method has been used to solve partial differential equations in higher dimensions with great success. Hence, it offers a computationally efficient approach to solving, for example, the Vlasov Equation which would allow for more detailed investigations of the dynamics of dark matter in the universe.

The package contains code for one and two dimensional hierarchical bases, as well as the cost vs interpolation error of a full grid and a sparse grid.
